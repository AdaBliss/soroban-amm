# Soroban AMM GraphQL Analytics API

Indexes pool events and exposes analytics queries with sub-100ms in-memory reads.

## Quick start

```bash
cd services/graphql-api
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:4000 for the Apollo Sandbox.

## Timestamps

Every timestamp in this API is **seconds since the Unix epoch**, not
milliseconds: `PoolEvent.timestamp`, `PricePoint.timestamp`,
`HealthAlert.firedAt`, and the `from` / `to` arguments of `priceHistory`
(both inclusive). Chain-derived values come straight from the ledger close
time, and the 30 day retention window and the one hour price deviation window
are measured against the indexer's clock, which is wall-clock time in
production and injectable in tests (`new PoolIndexer(clock)`).

In the code, timestamps are typed as `Seconds` (`src/time.ts`), so passing a
raw `Date.now()` where a timestamp is expected is a compile error. Convert
once at the boundary with `msToSeconds` or `isoToSeconds`.

## Example queries

### Pool TVL, volume, and fees

```graphql
query PoolOverview {
  poolStats(poolId: "pool-demo") {
    poolId
    tokenA
    tokenB
    tvl
    volume24h
    fees24h
    swapCount
  }
}
```

### Position tracking

```graphql
query MyPositions {
  positions(owner: "G...DEMO") {
    id
    poolId
    shares
    valueUsd
  }
}
```

### Historical price and fee data

```graphql
query PriceHistory {
  priceHistory(poolId: "pool-demo", from: 1700000000) {
    timestamp
    price
    feeBps
  }
}
```

### Time-weighted average liquidity (TWAL)

```graphql
query PoolTwal {
  twal(poolId: "pool-demo", windowSeconds: 3600)
}
```

Returns a time-weighted average price over the trailing `windowSeconds`, or
`null` if no price points were recorded for the pool in that window. Throws
a GraphQL error if `windowSeconds` is not greater than zero.

### Complex nested query

```graphql
query PoolDashboard($poolId: ID!) {
  poolStats(poolId: $poolId) {
    tvl
    volume24h
    fees24h
  }
  poolEvents(poolId: $poolId, limit: 50) {
    type
    timestamp
    payload
  }
  priceHistory(poolId: $poolId) {
    price
    timestamp
  }
}
```

### Event subscription

```graphql
subscription OnSwap($poolId: ID) {
  poolEvent(poolId: $poolId) {
    id
    type
    timestamp
    payload
  }
}
```

## Production indexing

Wire `PoolIndexer.indexEvent` to your Horizon/Soroban RPC ingestion pipeline for:
- `swap`, `add_liquidity`, `remove_liquidity` (AMM contract)
- `campaign_created`, `reward_distributed` (incentive campaigns)
